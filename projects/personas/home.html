	<h1>Television Remote Interface</h1>
	<h2>
		Do you think your television remote is designed to be the best interface for your television?
	</h2>
	<div class="remote">
		<img src="remote.jpg" id="sketch-image" alt="Remote Sketch" />
	</div>
	<div class="overview">
		<p>
			The television remote is included as an accessory for a television to be a handheld and distant point of
			control. As evident in the above sketch of an example remote design, there are many different sections on
			the remote, each with many buttons for various television functionality. However, all television remotes do
			not follow the same structure and semantics for their button setup.
		</p>
		<p>
			The question then becomes: <b>does the multitude of buttons and varying structure of television remote
				interfaces affect user experience?</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			To gain some insight on this question, I observed casual users interacting with television remotes and then
			interviewed them on their expectations and experiences from a television remote.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="observations">
		<h2>
			Observations
		</h2>
		</p>
		<h5>Question: Do you mind if I ask you to do some tasks to watch how you operate your television remote(s)?
		</h5>
		</p>
		These tasks included switching to a news channel, searching for a random channel, changing volume, switching
		back and forth between channels, and changing the video source.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Interviewed User 1:
		</h3>
		This user was confident and quick about pressing all buttons for each of the tasks asked. Even the more advanced
		features on the remote (like the search, last channel, and video source buttons) were utilized with ease. The
		user appeared annoyed when having to type using the arrow pad when searching for a channel.
		<h3>
			Interviewed User 2:
		</h3>
		The user was able to do the majority of the tasks, but they did not use the more advanced features of the remote
		to achieve the tasks (ie. scrolled through the guide to look for the channel instead of searching and scrolled
		to switch back instead of using last). The user pressed semi-random buttons to try to change the video source
		(they said they did it before) but gave up eventually. Also, they pressed the return button multiple times when
		the television was loading even though the signal was received.
		<h3>
			Interviewed User 3:
		</h3>
		This user was not particularly hesitant about pressing the buttons but was slow and decisive. The user had the
		channel number memorized for a news station and used the number pad to type it in. They used most of the
		advanced features except for the search feature; the user stated that they knew the task could be completed with
		search, but it would be too much of a hassle for them.

	</div>

	<div class="questions">
		<h2>Questions</h2>
		Take a look at a sample of the questions asked to users after the observations! Consider asking yourself about
		your expectations and experiences from a television remote while looking at these:

		<ol>
			<li>How would you define a television remote?</li>
			<li>Why would you want to use a television remote?</li>
			<li>What do you expect the physical composition of a television remote in terms of size and accessibility to
				be like?</li>
			<li>Can you describe a situation where a television remote interface caused you issues or was an
				inconvenience?</li>
			<li>Picture a situation where you have to use multiple remote controls at once to operate different devices
				(like one for the cable box and one for the television). On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being no
				inconvenience and 5 being an extreme inconvenience, how much of an inconvenience would the process of
				having to use multiple remotes for one system be?</li>
			<li>What features do you expect a television remote to provide?</li>
			<li>Would you prefer more or less button features on a television remote and why?</li>
			<ol>
	</div>

	<div class="summaries">
		<h2> Response Summaries</h2>
		<h3>
			Interviewed User 1:
		</h3>
		This user described themself as technologically savvy, and they use their television remote often. The user was
		very adamant about the television remote needing to transition towards having less buttons and repeatedly
		suggested having a smartphone-like touch screen interface. They stated that television remotes are unnecessarily
		complicated and not user friendly: too many buttons that do not have intuitive purposes. They feel very
		inconvenienced whenever dealing with a remote interface problem.
		<h3>
			Interviewed User 2:
		</h3>
		This user described themself as not being too experienced with technology, but they use their television remote
		every day. The user stated that the interfaces of their two remotes (for cable and television) are inconvenient
		and very different, but they have gotten used to them over time. They try to figure things out on the remotes
		either by asking someone or pressing random buttons that seem related. The user does not know what "more than
		half" of the buttons do.
		<h3>
			Interviewed User 3:
		</h3>
		This user described themself as technologically proficient, but they do not use their television remote too
		often. The user wanted the remote to be as ergonomic and tactile as possible. Their expectations for a
		television remote are low because they were raised without one (they needed to go to the television to control
		it). They want the remote to have a better visual feedback loop of signals (specifically when trying to change
		the video source in cable mode on a universal remote instead of on television mode).

	<div class="story">
		<h2>Storyboard</h2>
		<p>
			Now to really get a feel for an interaction with a remote, I created a storyboard of a narrative for
			<b>Doubtful Diane</b>, one of the personas formed above!
		</p>
		<div class="storyboard">
			<div class="storyimages">
				<figure>
					<img src="./storyboard/1.jpeg" alt="1" width="300" height="300" class="border" />
					<figcaption>
						This week, Diane cooked for and hosted her Bingo group. Glad that
						the dinner went well and exhausted from
						the day, Diane brings everyone to relax and watch television.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</div>
			<div class="storyimages">
				<figure>
					<img src="./storyboard/2.jpeg" alt="2" width="300" height="300" class="border" />
					<figcaption>
						She turns on the television using the remote as
						her grandson taught her and keyed in the number
						for the cooking channel.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</div>
			<div class="storyimages">
				<figure=>
					<img src="./storyboard/3.jpeg" alt="3" width="300" height="300" class="border" />
					<figcaption>
						Someone says they hate the cooking channel; the
						rest of the group talks and decides they want
						to watch the History Channel.
					</figcaption>
					</figure>
			</div>
			<div class="storyimages">
				<figure>
					<img src="./storyboard/4.jpeg" alt="4" width="300" height="300" class="border" />
					<figcaption>
						Diane looks at the remote for a while examining
						for a search button like her grandson used.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</div>
			<div class="storyimages">
				<figure>
					<img src="./storyboard/5.jpeg" alt="5" width="300" height="300" class="border" />
					<figcaption>
						Eventually, she gives up and scrolls through
						television guides instead because the group is
						getting impatient.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</div>
			<div class="storyimages">
				<figure>
					<img src="./storyboard/6.jpeg" alt="6" width="300" height="300" class="border" />
					<figcaption>
						After 10 minutes of looking, one of her friends
						remembers that she brought a movie CD and asks
						Diane to switch the video input to the CD
						player instead.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</div>
			<div class="storyimages">
				<figure>
					<img src="./storyboard/7.jpeg" alt="7" width="300" height="300" class="border" />
					<figcaption>
						Diane hits the source button as her grandson
						taught her but forgets to switch the universal
						remote to television mode.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</div>
			<div class="storyimages">
				<figure>
					<img src="./storyboard/8.jpeg" alt="8" width="300" height="300" class="border" />
					<figcaption>
						After another 10 minutes of trying to switch
						to the video input, Diane is completely flustered
						and turns off the television.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</div>
			<div class="storyimages">
				<figure>
					<img src="./storyboard/9.jpeg" class="border" alt="9" width="300" height="300" />
					<figcaption>
						She suggests to the group that she can host another
						round of Bingo, and the group is content with that.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="conclusion">
		<h2>Conclusions</h2>
		<p>
			An experience with the television remote like the one shown in the storyboard did not ruin the night of
			Diane and her family, but it was a non-trivial inconvenience. However, isn't the whole point of the remote
			to be an interface for the television that makes life easier?
		</p>

		<p>
			If you think the television remote isn't designed to be the best interface for a television, I recommend you
			to be the change you want to see in the world and design a better remote!

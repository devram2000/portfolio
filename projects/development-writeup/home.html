    In this project, I began to explore the usefulness of the component-based React web framework. 
    Specifically, the purpose of this project is to use the React functionality
    to create filtering, sorting, and accumulating for a list-based application. I decided to utilize the concept
    of selecting cards from a deck for this purpose.

    <h2>Functionality</h2>
    <div class="overview">
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        The overall goal of this application was to provide an easy means for people to create a "hand" of cards and
        to view the total score of that hand. To do this, values of 2 to 14 were assigned for cards from 2 through Ace.
      </p>
      <p>
        To easily add and remove cards from the user's hand, the user can filter the deck by card description (number), suit,
        and color. The user can also sort by value of cards in ascending or descending order. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When a card is added to the hand, it's value is automatically added to the "Total Hand Value" for a quick way for 
        users to determine the total value of their hand.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="usability">
      <h3>Usability</h3>
      <p>For usability purposes, various functionalities were added to assist users and more align this application to the mental model of users for a card deck:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When a card is moved to the hand, it is removed from the deck view as it would be when playing with physical cards.</li>
        <li>The entire box for a card and it's textual summary can be clicked on to easily move cards between the hand and the deck.</li>
        <li>A "Remove Filters and Sort" button is added for convenience that returns the deck to it's original ordering.</li>
        <li>A "Reset Hand" button is added for convenience that returns all cards in the hand to the deck.</li>
        <li>A shuffle deck feature is added that removes the filters and sorts and shuffles the order of the deck (the hand remains the same intentionally).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      In the end, this project was developed to examine React as a framework for creating useful applications. 
      Moving forward, this particular application does have much room for improvement (user ability to change 
      card values like the Ace, visual design tweaks, improving accessibility, etc.), but we can definitely see that React can be used to transform
      basic web interfaces into much more useful and complex resources!
